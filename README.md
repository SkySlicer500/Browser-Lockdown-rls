# Browser-Lockdown-rls
The release pool for the Browser Lockdown project

Browser Lockdown is a browser software that restricts the internet access of the user, and is particularly designed to be used in tandem with YouTube.

Browser Lockdown's intended audience is parents who want to restrict what YouTube content their children will end up viewing.

The browser uses a whitelist to determine what youtube channels are allowed to be viewed. When a website or channel that is not allowed is viewed, the browser will automatically redirect to the hub page.

This is a new variation of the app that is now embedded within a browser to effectively get the information it needs to limit the user's access. Before, this was done through a bot, however those trials proved inconsistent between systems. As well the distributors of the backend used for the bot fell under, resulting in the bot being built in tandem with the browser itself.

# Installing
Browser Lockdown is currently only available for Windows.

If you are installing Browser Lockdown for the first time, you should go to the latest release, download the zip folder, unzip the downloading zip folder, then run the setup.exe file.
